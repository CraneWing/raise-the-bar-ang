# Raise the Bar

Raise the Bar is the second of Free Code Camp's full-stack challenges. This is a nightlife coordination app that enables users to plan their nighttime outings. They can search for local bars served via the Yelp API. They can login and add themselves to individual bars to let friends know they are going out. When logged in, their searches also are saved.

These are the "user stories" this app must fulfill:

    * As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.
    * As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.
    * As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.
    * As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.

App is Node based, with Express and Angular with MongoDB for user database. Passport provides user verification and authentication. Custom webfonts are used, along with free icons from Ionic and photos from Unsplash.
