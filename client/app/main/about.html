      <p>This is the second of the <a href="http://freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">Free Code Camp</a> full stack challenges to create an app that looks for nightspots in the user's local area and allows them to add themselves to a list that indicates they are going to a location.

      <p>It uses a simple version of the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node). The challenge provides experience to the FCC student in full stack development and managing a third-party API.</p>
      
      <p>The app uses a variety of free and open source resources. They are the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fonts:</strong> From <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com" target="_blank">Font Squirrel</a>. The header font is Bitstream Vera Sans, and the body text is Liberation Serif.</li>
        <li><strong>Icons:</strong> All icons are from <a href="http://www.ionicons.com" target="_blank">Iconic Icons</a> and were originally developed for use with the Ionic framework.</li>
        <li><strong>Photos:</strong> All are from the free image site <a href="http://www.unsplash.com" target="_blank">Unsplash</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Search API:</strong> The Yelp <a href="https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api" target="_blank">search API v2.0</a> is used to provide bar data.</li>
